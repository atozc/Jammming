## Introduction 
A React web app that uses the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to allow users to search Spotify, create a custom playlist, modify existing playlists, and then save the playlist to their Spotify accounts. 
Note: Requires having a Spotify account for playlists to be saved.

### Tech Stack
- React 
- Spotify API

## Setup 
1. Clone or download the repo
2. In the root directory, create a `.env` file and put your Spotify API key equal to `REACT_APP_API_KEY`
3. Open the directory and run `npm install` to install any dependencies 
4. Run the app locally by using `npm start`
5. Build the app for production `npm run build`
